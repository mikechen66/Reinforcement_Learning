# Reinforcement_Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the major driver behind the ground-breaking applications
including DeepMind's Protein Folding and AlphaGo. In addition, the RL is merging with 
the Graph Neural Network. It is worth thorough explorarion and exploiratationb in order 
to obtain the new knowledge, insights and practices for the coming fusing of the RL and 
GNN.
